## Analysis of Mouse Secondary Motor Cortex (MOs)
***_Please note that the data displayed here is only a subset of MOs dataset reported in Fang 2019 paper._***        
In Fang 2019, mouse secondary motor cortex is dissected into three slices namely anterior, middle nad posterior slice, each contains two biological replicates. Here as a demonstration, we only used `CEMBA180306_2B` which is the first replicate for middle (2nd) slice.

**Step 1. Barcode Demultiplexing**.         
We first de-multicomplex FASTQ file by adding the barcode to the beginning of each read in the following format: "@" + "barcode" + ":" + "read_name". Below is one example of demultiplexed fastq file. Because barcode design can be very different between experiments and platforms, we decide not to include this part in the current analysis pipline. However, this can be easily implemented by awk or python script. Here download a subset of MOs dataset for demonstration of SnapATAC pipeline.
    
```bash
$ wget http://renlab.sdsc.edu/r3fang/share/Fang_2019/MOs_snATAC/fastq/CEMBA180306_2B.demultiplexed.R1.fastq.gz

```

**Step 2. Index Reference Genome (snaptools)**.       
Index the reference genome before alingment (skip this step if you already have done this before). Here we show how to index the genome using BWA. User can switch to other aligner by `--aligner ` tag. Specify the aligner path by `--path-to-aligner`. For instance, if `bwa` is installed under `/opt/biotools/bwa/bin/bwa` on my server, then set `--path-to-aligner=/opt/biotools/bwa/bin/`.

```bash
$ which bwa
/opt/biotools/bwa/bin/bwa 
$ snaptools index-genome  \
	--input-fasta=mm10.fa  \
	--output-prefix=mm10  \
    --aligner=bwa  \
	--path-to-aligner=/opt/biotools/bwa/bin/  \
	--num-threads=5
```

**Step 3. Alignment (snaptools)**.        
We next aligned de-multicomplexed reads to the corresponding reference genome using snaptools with following command. After alignment, reads are automatically sorted by the read names which allows for grouping reads according to the barcode (`--if-sort`). User can use mutiple CPUs to speed up this step by setting (`--num-threads`).

```bash
$ snaptools align-paired-end  \
	--input-reference=mm10.fa  \
	--input-fastq1=CEMBA180306_2B.demultiplexed.R1.fastq.gz  \
	--input-fastq2=CEMBA180306_2B.demultiplexed.R2.fastq.gz  \
	--output-bam= CEMBA180306_2B.bam  \
	--aligner=bwa  \
	--path-to-aligner=path_to_bwa/bin/  \
	--read-fastq-command=zcat  \
	--min-cov=0  \
	--num-threads=5  \
	--if-sort=True  \
	--tmp-folder=./  \
	--overwrite=TRUE                     
```

**Step 4. Pre-processing (snaptools)**.          
After alignment, we converted pair-end reads into fragments and for each fragment we check the following attributes: 1) mapping quality score MAPQ; 2) whether two ends are appropriately paired according to the alignment flag information; 3) fragment length. We only keep the properly paired fragments whose MAPQ (`--min-mapq`) is greater than 30 with fragment length less than 1000bp (`--max-flen`). Because the reads have been sorted based on the barcodes (integrated into read names), fragments belonging to the same barcode are naturally grouped together which allows for removing PCR duplicates seperately. After alignment and filtration, we generated a snap-format (Single-Nucleus Accessibility Profiles) file that contains meta data, cell-by-bin count matrices of a variety of resolutions, cell-by-peak count matrix. Detailed information about snap file can be found in [here](https://github.com/r3fang/SnapTools/blob/master/docs/snap_format.docx). In the below example, barcodes of fragments less than 100 `--min-cov=100` are filtered in order to speed up the process and save memory. Please note this is not selection of high-quality cells used for clustering.  

```bash
$ snaptools snap-pre  \
	--input-file=CEMBA180306_2B.bam  \
	--output-snap=CEMBA180306_2B.snap  \
	--genome-name=mm10  \
	--genome-size=mm10.chrom.sizes  \
	--min-mapq=30  \
	--min-flen=0  \
	--max-flen=1000  \
	--keep-chrm=TRUE  \
	--keep-single=TRUE  \
	--keep-secondary=False  \
	--overwrite=True  \
	--min-cov=100  \
	--verbose=True
```

**Step 5. Cell-by-Bin Matrix Generation (snaptools)**.          
Using generated snap file, we next created the cell-by-bin matrix. Snap file allows for storing cell-by-bin matrices of different resolutions. In the below example, three cell-by-bin matrices are created with bin size of 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000. Note that this does not create a new file, all the matrices are stored in `CEMBA180306_2B.snap`. 


```bash
$ snaptools snap-add-bmat             \
	--snap-file=CEMBA180306_2B.snap    \
	--bin-size-list 1000 5000 10000    \
	--verbose=True
```

**Step 6. Cell-by-gene Matrix Generation (snaptools)**.      
We next create the cell-by-gene count matrix which is later used for cluster annotation.

```bash
$ snaptools snap-add-gmat             \
	--snap-file=CEMBA180306_2B.snap    \
	--gtf-file=gencode.vM16.gene.bed  \
	--verbose=True
```

**Step 7. Barcode Selection (SnapATAC)**.       
Using snap file, we next identify the high-quality barcode based on the following metrices: 1) `fragment.num` - Total Sequencing Fragments; 2) `umap.ratio` - uniquely mapped ratio; 3) `dup.ratio ` - duplate ratio; 4) `pair.ratio` - properly paired ratio; 5) `mito.ratio` - mitochondrial ratio. 

We no longer use reads in peak ratio as a metrics for cell selection mainly for two reasons. First, we found the reads-in-peak ration is highly cell type specific. For instance, according to published single cell ATAC-seq, human fibroblast (BJ) cells have significantly higher reads in peak ratio (40-60%) versus 20-40% for GM12878 cells. Similarly, we found Glia cells overall have very different reads in peak ratio distribution compared to neuronal cells. We suspect this may reflect the nucleus size or global chromatin accessibility. Second, pre-defined set of accessibility peaks are incomplete and are biased to the dominant populations. In Fang et al, when studying complex tissue such as mammalian brain, we found over 50% of the peaks present in the rare populations are not identified from the aggregate signal or bulk analysis. Therefore, we abandoned the use of reads in peak ratio for cell selection. 

```R
$ R
> library(SnapATAC);
> x.sp = createSnap("CEMBA180306_2B.snap", metaData=TRUE);
> plotBarcode(x.sp);                             
```

<img src="./Barcode_QC.png" width="400" height="400" />

```R
# filter cells based on the following cutoffs
> x.sp = filterCells(x.sp, 
                   subset.names=c("fragment.num",
                                  "mito.ratio",
                                  "dup.ratio",
                                  "umap.ratio",
                                  "pair.ratio"),
                   low.thresholds=c(1000, 0, 0, 0.8, 0.9),
                   high.thresholds=c(Inf, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1)
                  );
> x.sp

```

**Step 8. Bin Size Selection (snapATAC)**.        
Using remaining cells, we next choose the optimal bin size based on the correlation between replicates. If there are no biological replicates given, the cells are evenly split into two pseudo-replicates. We recommend chosing the smallest bin size that have correlation greater than 0.95.

```R
# show what bin sizes exist in CEMBA180306_2B.snap file
> showBinSizes("CEMBA180306_2B.snap");
# try 1kb resolution
> x.sp = addBmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap", binSize=1000);
> x.sp = makeBinary(x.sp, "bmat");
> checkBinSize(x.sp);
# try 5kb resolution
> x.sp = addBmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap", binSize=5000);
> x.sp = makeBinary(x.sp, "bmat");
> checkBinSize(x.sp);
# try 10kb resolution
> x.sp = addBmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap", binSize=10000);
> x.sp = makeBinary(x.sp, "bmat");
> checkBinSize(x.sp);
# based on the correlation, we choose 5kb resolution. 
# in most cases, we recommand for 5kb resolution
> x.sp = addBmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap", binSize=5000);
```

**Step 9. Matrix Binarization (snapATAC)**.         
For cell-by-bin count matrix, we next convert it to a binary matrix. We found some items in the matrix can have exceedingly high coverage perhaps due to the alignment error. Therefore, we first remove top 0.1% items in the count matrix and then convert it to a binary matrix.

```R
> x.sp = makeBinary(x.sp, mat="bmat");
```

**Step 10. Feature Selection (snapATAC)**.        
We next filtered any bins overlapping with the [ENCODE blacklist](http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/) and bins belonging to chrM or random chromsomes to prevent from any potential artifacts Bins of exceedingly high coverage which likely represent the genomic regions that are invariable between cells such as housekeeping gene promoters were removed. We noticed that filtering bins of extremely low coverage perhaps due to random noise can also improve the robustness of the downstream clustering analysis. In detail, we calculated the coverage of each bin using the binary matrix and normalized the coverage by `log10(count + 1)`. We found the log-scaled coverage obey approximately a gaussian distribution which is then converted into zscore. In the following example, bins with zscore beyond ±2 were filtered. 

```R
> black_list = read.table("mm10.blacklist.bed.gz");
> black_list.gr = GRanges(
                          black_list[,1], 
                          IRanges(black_list[,2], black_list[,3])
                         );
> idy1 = queryHits(findOverlaps(x.sp@feature, black_list.gr));
> idy2 = grep("chrM|random", x.sp@feature);
> idy = unique(c(idy1, idy2));
> x.sp = x.sp[,-idy, mat="bmat"];
> plotBinCoverage(x.sp);
```
<img src="./Bin_coverage.png" width="300" height="300" />


```R
> x.sp = filterBins(
	x.sp,
	low.threshold=-2,
	high.threshold=2,
	mat="bmat"
	);
> x.sp

number of barcodes: 11251
number of bins: 476589
number of peaks: 0
number of genes: 0
==========================
meta data            (metData) :  TRUE
cellxbin matrix      (bmat)    :  TRUE
cellxpeak matrix     (pmat)    :  FALSE
cellxgene matrix     (gmat)    :  FALSE
jaccard matrix       (jmat)    :  FALSE
normalization        (nmat)    :  FALSE
PCA:                 (smat)    :  FALSE

t-sne:               (tsne)    :  FALSE
umap:                (umap)    :  FALSE

```


**Step 11. Jaccard Matrix & Normlaization (snapATAC)**.            
We next convert the genome-wide cell-by-bin matrix into a cell-by-cell similarity matrix by estimating the jaccard index between two cells in the basis of overlaps. Instead of calculating a full N-by-N jaccard matrix, we calculate a partial jaccard index matrix by randomly choosing K cells (`max.var`). By doing so, we demonstrate that it does not sacriface the performance but significantly improves the running time. Due to the high dropout rate, the jaccard index is highly biased toward high coverage cells. To remove the read depth effect, we developed a normalization method (`norm.method`).
  
```R
> x.sp = calJaccard(
	x.sp,
	mat = "bmat",
	ncell.chunk=1000,
	max.var=5000,
	seed.use=10,
	norm.method="normOVE",
	row.center=TRUE,
	row.scale=TRUE,
	low.threshold=-5,
	high.threshold=5,
	keep.jmat=FALSE,
	do.par=TRUE,
	num.cores=5
	)
``` 

**Step 12. PCA (snapATAC)**.             
Like other single-cell analysis, scATAC-seq contains extensive technical noise due to the high drop-out rate. To overcome this challenge, PCA or SVD is often applied to combine information across a correlated feature set hereby creating a mega-feature and exclude the variance potential resulting from technical noise. Here, we performed PCA against the normalized matrix. We used IRLBA algorithm, a fast and memory-efficient algorithm, to compute a partial PCA. IRLBA is implemented in  `irlba` R package.

```R
> x.sp = runPCA(
	x.sp,
	pc.num=50,
	input.mat="nmat",
	method="svd",
	weight.by.sd=TRUE,
	center=TRUE,
	scale=FALSE,
	seed.use=10
	)
```

**Step 13. Determine statistically significant principal components (snapATAC)**.          
We next Determine how many PCs to include for downstream analysis. We use an ad hoc method for determining which PCs to use is to look at a plot of the standard deviations of the principle components and draw your cutoff where there is a clear elbow in the graph. The other ad hoc way to determine PCs is to plot out every two PCs and select until PCs that have no obvious structure. 

```R
> plotPCA(x.sp, method="elbow");
> plotPCA(x.sp, method="pairwise");
```
<img src="./PCA_elbow_plot.png" width="300" height="300" /> <img src="./PCA_scatter_plot.png" width="300" height="300" />

**Step 14. Clustering (snapATAC)**.       
 Using the selected significant PCs, we next calculated pairwise Euclidean distance between every two cells, using this distance, we created a k-nearest neighbor graph in which every cell is represented as a node and edges are drawn between cells within `k` nearest neighbors. Edge weight between any two cells are refined by shared overlap in their local neighborhoods using Jaccard similarity. Finally, we applied community finding algorithm Louvain to identify the ‘communities’ in the resulting graph with different `resolution` which represents groups of cells sharing similar ATAC-seq profiles, potentially originating from the same cell type. This step requires `snaptools` to be installed frist and `path_to_snaptools` indicates the folder that contains the `snaptools` excutable file.

```R
> x.sp = runCluster(
	x.sp,
	pca_dims=1:25,
	k=15,
	resolution=0.7,
	method="louvain",
	path_to_snaptools="/home/r3fang/anaconda2/bin/snaptools"
	)
```

**Step 15. Visulization (snapATAC)**.          
snapATAC allows using tSNE, UMAP and FIt-sne to visualize and explore these datasets. In the following example, data is visulized by tsne implemented by R package (`Rtsne`).

```R
# tsne
> x.sp = runViz(
	x.sp, 
	pca_dims=1:25, 
	dims=2, 
	method="Rtsne"
	)
# umap
> x.sp = runViz(
	x.sp, 
	pca_dims=1:25, 
	dims=2, 
	method="umap"
	)

> plotViz(x.sp, method="tsne", pch=19, cex=0.5);
> plotViz(x.sp, method="umap", pch=19, cex=0.5);
```

<img src="./Viz_tsne.png" width="350" height="350" /> <img src="./Viz_tsne_label.png" width="350" height="350" />
<img src="./Viz_umap.png" width="350" height="350" /> <img src="./Viz_umap_label.png" width="350" height="350" />

**Step 16. Gene-body based annotation for expected cell types (snapATAC)**.        
To help annotate identified cell clusters, snapATAC next loads the cell-by-gene matrix which estimates the gene body accessibility level.

```R
> x.sp = addGmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap");
> x.sp = scaleCountMatrix(
	x.sp, 
	cov=rowSums(x.sp, mat="bmat"),
	mat="gmat"
	);
> marker.genes = c(
	"Snap25", "Gad2", "Apoe", "C1qb", "Pvalb", 
	"Vip", "Sst", "Lamp5", "Slc17a7", "Mog", 
	"Pdgfra", "Cspg4","Cx3cr1","F3","Aqp4", "Rorb"
	);
> plotGene.default(
	x.sp, 
	gene.sel=marker.genes, 
	method="tsne",
	binary=FALSE,
	cex=0.1,
	background=TRUE
	);
```

<img src="./gene_plot.png" width="500" height="500" />

**Step 17. Heretical clustering of the clusters (snapATAC)**. 

```R
# calculate the ensemble signals for each cluster
> ensemble.ls = lapply(split(seq(length(x.sp@cluster)), x.sp@cluster), function(x){
	colMeans(x.sp@bmat[x,])
	})
# cluster using 1-cor as distance  
> hc = hclust(as.dist(1 - cor(t(do.call(rbind, ensemble.ls)))), method="ward.D2");
> plot(hc, hang=-1, xlab="");
```

<img src="./Viz_tsne_label.png" width="300" height="300" /> <img src="./cluster_tree.png" width="350" height="300" />

**Step 18. Gene-body based annotation for excitatory neurons**.        
We next extracted the clusters belonging to excitatory neurons based on the gene accessibility level for Slc17a7 and plot layer-specific marker genes enrichment.

```R
> idx = which(x.sp@cluster %in% c(3, 11, 5, 6, 10, 17, 4, 8, 12));
> marker.genes = c(
	"Cux1", "Cux2", "Rorb", "Deptor", 
	"Vat1l", "Sulf1", "Tle4", "Foxp2", 
	"Tshz2", "Grik3", "Bcl6"
	);
> plotGene(
	x.sp[idx,], 
	gene.sel=marker.genes, 
	method="tsne",
	binary=FALSE,
	cex=0.1,
	plot.row=4,
	plot.col=4,
	xlim=c(min(x.sp@tsne[,1]), max(x.sp@tsne[,1])),
	ylim=c(min(x.sp@tsne[,2]), max(x.sp@tsne[,2])),
	background=TRUE,
	);
```

<img src="./gene_plot_exc.png" width="500" height="375" />

**Step 19. Create chromatin lanscape and identify cis-elements for each cluster seperately**.      
We first export the meta data which includes barcode, cluster, tsne, umap coordinates, quality control metrics.

```R
> write.metadata(
	obj=x.sp, 
	file="CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.txt",
	subset.names=c("barcode", "cluster")
	)
```

Now you need to open a new window for the following command but **DO NOT EXIST R SESSION** because we are coming back after a few steps. In this case, as the second column is the cluster label, check the number of cells per cluster by the following command `cut -f2 CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.txt | sort | uniq -c`. We recomand perform peak calling for cluster with cell number over 500. Below is an example for calling peaks for cluster 1 which has 972 cells. 

```bash
$ awk '{if($2 == 1) print}' CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.txt > CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1.txt
$ which macs2
/home/r3fang/anaconda2/bin/

$ snaptools call-peak  \
	--snap-file=snap/CEMBA180306_2B.snap  \
	--barcode-file=CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1.txt  \
	--output-prefix=CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1  \
	--path-to-macs=/home/r3fang/anaconda2/bin/  \
	--gsize=mm
```

This command creates the following files in which `CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1_peaks.narrowPeak` is the peaks identified:

```
CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1_peaks.narrowPeak
CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1_peaks.xls
CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1_summits.bed
CEMBA180306_2B.metadata.C1_treat_pileup.bdg
```

Repeat the above proccess for other clusters with cells more than 500 and merge all peak (narrowPeak) files to create a reference map. Here we download the `all_peak.bed` identified from all MOs data described in Fang 2019. 

***The chromatin landscapes created and displayed in Fang 2019 paper can be viewed at***:

[<img src="./tracks.png" width="700" height="300" />](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/legacy/?genome=mm10&session=EI4x6DK2wb&statusId=1821883640)



**Step 20. Create a cell-by-peak matrix**.     
We next create cell by peak matrix using the sanp file and `all_peak.bed`.

```
$ snaptools snap-add-pmat  \
	--snap-file=snap/CEMBA180306_2B.snap  \
	--peak-file= all_peak.bed  
```


**Step 21. Identify differential accessible regions (DARs)**.    
Now we go back to the R session and continue the SnapATAC. We identify cis-elements that are enriched in Sst subtype.

```R
> x.sp = addPmat(x.sp, "CEMBA180306_2B.snap");
> x.sp = makeBinary(x.sp, mat="pmat");
> barcodes = x.sp@barcode[which(x.sp@cluster == 15)];
> idy = findDAR(
	object=x.sp, 
	mat="pmat",
	barcodes.sel=barcodes,
	bcv=0.4, 
	rand.seed=10, 
	pca_dims=1:25,
	fdr=1e-1,
	method="exactTest",

**Step 22. Infer master regulators**.           
Motif analysis using homer (see how to install [homer](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/introduction/install.html)). After installing homer, you can run the below step.

```R
> motifs = runHomer(
	x.sp[,idy,"pmat"], 
	mat = "pmat",
	path_to_homer = "/projects/ps-renlab/r3fang/public_html/softwares/homer/bin/findMotifsGenome.pl",
	result_dir = "./homer/Sst",
	genome = 'mm10',
	motif_length = 10,
	scan_size = 300,
	optimize_count = 2,
	background = 'automatic',
	local_background = FALSE,
	only_known = FALSE,
	only_denovo = FALSE,
	fdr_num = 5,
	cores = 10,
	cache = 100,
	overwrite = TRUE,
	keep_minimal = FALSE
	)
> head(motifs[,1:3])

                                                     Motif.Name    Consensus	P.value

See the full list of motifs enriched for Sst [here](http://renlab.sdsc.edu/r3fang/share/Fang_2019/MOs_snATAC/motifs/Sst/knownResults.html).

**Step 23. Sub-clustering of Sst subtype**.              
GABAergic neurons are composed of highly diverse neurons. Previous single cell RNA-seq analysis has revealed extensive amount of GABAergic subtypes. Here we perform sub-cluster of Sst to further identify its subtype. This can be applied to other cell types, here we only demonstrate for Sst.
